这是一个测试文件

目的是用来测试命令 git diff HEAD 和 git diff -- HEAD

When an argument can be misunderstood as either a revision or a path, they can be disambiguated by placing -- between them. E.g.  git diff -- HEAD is, "I have a file
called HEAD in my work tree. Please show changes between the version I staged in the index and what I have in the work tree for that file", not "show difference between
the HEAD commit and the work tree as a whole". You can say git diff HEAD -- to ask for the latter.
